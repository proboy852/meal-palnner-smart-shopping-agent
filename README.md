# AI SmartMeal — Meal Planner & Smart Shopping Agent

This project is a multi-agent system that builds a weekly meal plan, extracts ingredients, creates a shopping list, and estimates grocery cost. It supports optional LLM mode (Google Gemini) but works fully offline with fallback logic.

See `kaggle_writeup.md` for the submission text and `examples/` for sample runs.
